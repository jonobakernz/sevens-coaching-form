# Sevens Coaching Form: release notes

Updated 25 Sept 2026. Current release: 22.

## At a glance

Release 22 is live at <https://jonobakernz.github.io/sevens-coaching-form/>. It is a phone app. Coaches use it to
score referees. Organisers use it to rank them.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the repo is public -- GitHub Pages does not support private repositories
on the Free plan. No coaching data lives in the repo itself, only fictional demo data.

Coaching-results uploads and in-app feedback both go to SnapItForms. Both are new to this project, so watch real
submissions closely -- see the Support reference below before relying on either for a real event.

A coach scores a game, the phone saves it, and the coach uploads it. The app works without signal. An organiser
sets up a tournament with one QR code and reviews every referee in one table.

Main changes since the first release:

- A New Zealand rugby look, with a black jersey theme and te reo Māori labels.
- Eight scored areas, score meanings, quick notes and feedback boxes.
- Dictation and voice notes in every comment box.
- Upload, email, share and print options.
- Organiser tools: setup QR code, referee ranking, coach marking, and a demo tournament.

## What is new for coaches

A coach can score a game in about 15 taps. Notes can be typed, spoken, or recorded.

**Scoring**

- Score eight areas from 1 to 5: fitness, foul play, breakdowns, set phase, game awareness, game management, communication, and an overall rating.
- Communication is a new area. "Good position" is a new choice under distance from contest.
- Each score shows a one-line meaning, such as "3. Meets the standard for this level." Open "How to score" to see all five.
- "Tap a score to set it. Tap it again to clear it." is shown on screen above the scores, not just in "How to score".
- Under distance from contest, "Too close" and "In the way" can both apply. "Good position" is a separate choice and clears the other two. A line under the buttons explains this, and "Good position" now sits apart from the other two.

**Notes**

- Quick notes add a ready phrase to a comment box with one tap.
- Foul play, breakdowns and game management each have new quick notes, taken from the printed coaching sheet: recognising foul play and applying the law, respecting the jackler's rights and getting the ball available quickly, and being proactive rather than reactive.
- "Strength to keep" and "One thing to work on" are for the referee.
- Private notes stay out of the summary, the email and the print. The organiser sees them after an upload.
- Dictation: tap the microphone in any comment box and speak. Say "full stop", "comma", "question mark" or "new line" for punctuation.
- Voice notes: tap the wave button. Record up to 2 minutes. Then play, record again, share or delete the clip.
- The microphone and wave buttons are lighter now, so the form reads less cluttered. They still work the same and are still easy to tap.

**Match details**

- Referee, field and time are always on screen. Coach, tournament, date, level, game and role sit under "Match details". The app remembers them.
- Coach sits beside Referee, Field and Time, always on screen. It is needed before the first upload.
- If the organiser has set up a referee list, the app suggests names and checks the spelling.
- Once the referee name and the rating are in, "Start next game" is ready. It copies the tournament, coach and level, and adds one to the game number. It does not need an upload first, so it works with no signal.

**Saving and sending**

- The form saves on the phone as you type. Losing signal loses nothing.
- "Upload results" sends the form. "Upload all waiting" sends every form not yet uploaded. A yellow number on the Saved tab shows how many wait.
- "Share summary", "Copy text", "Email this form" and "Print or save PDF" all work. Share summary also sends voice notes where the phone allows it.
- A coach must enter a name before the first upload.
- On the Saved tab, each form has its own delete button. Deleting no longer means opening the form first.
- "Select forms to delete" ticks off several forms at once and removes them together, with one confirmation.
- If "Upload all waiting" stops partway, the message now names the referee whose form failed, not just "the next one".
- The rating badge on each saved form now labels itself correctly for a screen reader, found in a full accessibility scan of all four tabs.
- "Feedback" in Setup sends a note straight to the organiser, the same way results upload. Needs signal. If there is none, the note is copied so it can be sent another way. There was no way to send feedback from inside the app before.

**Look and feel**

- A black jersey theme, a welcome screen on the first visit, and a compact header after that.
- Four tabs at the top: Form, Saved, Review and Setup.
- Larger buttons and clearer text. The accessibility scan finds no problems.
- Sun mode (white and black, heavy edges) for bright fields. Dark mode follows the phone.
- Te reo Māori labels sit beside the English ones. Dates and times use New Zealand style.

## What is new for organisers

An organiser can set up a tournament with one scan and rank every referee across all games and coaches.

**Setup tab**

- Make a setup link and QR code. It holds the tournament name, tournament code, field names, levels, coaches and referees.
- Coaches scan the QR code in the app, paste the link, or open the link. Their lists fill in.
- The tournament code goes with every upload. Loading a results file skips rows with a wrong or missing code. The code is a filter, not a password.
- Open "Referees and coaches" under "This device" to check the names a setup loaded, without exporting anything.

**Review tab**

- A ranked table shows games, coaches, rating and the seven area averages. Tap a heading to sort. Tap a name to read every comment, private notes included.
- Filters: tournament, role, date range and minimum games.
- A referee with fewer games than the minimum is "provisional" and has no rank.
- "Adjust ratings for coach marking style" corrects for hard and easy markers. It adjusts only coaches with 3 or more forms.
- The coach marking table shows each coach's forms, average and difference from all coaches.
- "Needs more assessments" lists referees below the minimum, including those with no games.
- "Names" finds spellings that look alike and offers to merge them.
- The table fits a laptop screen. On a phone, each referee is a card instead, with a "Sort by" box above the list in place of tapping a heading.

**Results**

- Each upload is one submission in the SnapItForms dashboard.
- Feedback from a coach is a separate submission, told apart by a `kind` field.
- "Load results file" reads a CSV or JSON export and merges it. "Export ranking table (CSV)" saves the ranking.
- The Saved tab still has the CSV export and the backup file.

**Demo and training**

- Setup, then "Demo and training", loads 45 made-up games. Demo forms are never uploaded. "Remove the demo data" clears them and keeps real forms.

## Release history

There have been 22 releases, newest first. Dates are New Zealand time. The last column helps support tell which release a phone has.

| Date | Release | What changed | How to spot it on a phone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 25 Sept 2026 | 22. Moved to GitHub Pages, feedback moved to SnapItForms | The site now lives at jonobakernz.github.io/sevens-coaching-form/. The repo is now public, which GitHub Pages requires on the Free plan. Feedback now sends to SnapItForms, the same way results upload does. | The address in the browser is different. Setup and coaching are otherwise unchanged. |
| 25 Sept 2026 | 21. Coaching-results upload moved to SnapItForms (trial) | Upload results now posts to SnapItForms. It has no independent track record yet -- see Support reference. Feedback did not change in this release. | No visible change on the form itself. The upload status line now says "This is a trial upload service." |
| 23 Sept 2026 | 20. Quick notes from the printed coaching sheet | Compared the printed "7's Coaching Notes" sheet with the app and added the quick notes it was missing: two for foul play (recognising it early, applying the law), two for breakdowns (the jackler's rights, getting the ball available), and one for game management (proactive, not just reactive). | Two extra quick-note buttons on Foul play and Breakdowns, one extra on Game management. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 19. Feedback sends straight to the organiser | Release 18's "Feedback" sent an email, but many phones have no mail app set up to actually send one. It now sends the same way results upload: straight into the organiser's account. If there is no signal, the note is copied to send another way. The organiser no longer sets up an address for this. | Tap "Send feedback": the button says "Sending...", then either sends or copies the note. It does not open a mail app. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 18. Feedback | A "Feedback" box in Setup opened the phone's mail app, addressed to the organiser if one was set up. Replaced by release 19, since many phones have no mail app configured to actually send from. | Tap "Send feedback": the phone's mail app opens. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 17. Accessibility fix | A full accessibility scan of all four tabs found one real issue: the rating badge on the Saved tab was not labelled correctly for a screen reader. Fixed. | No visible change. Check with a screen reader on the Saved tab. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 16. Small fixes | A failed "Upload all waiting" names the referee whose form failed. Setup can show the referee and coach list without exporting. | "Referees and coaches" under "This device" in Setup. A named referee in a failed upload message. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 15. Review table on phone | On a phone, the referee ranking is a list of cards instead of a sideways-scrolling table, with a "Sort by" box in place of tappable headings. The microphone and wave buttons are lighter. | A "Sort by" box above the ranking. Cards instead of a wide table. Thinner voice buttons. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 14. Clearer scoring hints | A visible hint above the scores explains tapping a score again clears it. The distance-from-contest buttons show which two can combine and which one is separate. | "Tap a score to set it..." above the score rows. A short line and a gap before "Good position". |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 13. Delete several forms at once | "Select forms to delete" on the Saved tab ticks off several forms and removes them together. | A "Select forms to delete" button above the Saved list. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 12. Coaching workflow fixes | Coach moved out of "Match details" onto the main screen. "Start next game" no longer waits for an upload. Each Saved form has its own delete button. | Coach sits beside Referee, Field and Time. A bin icon on each row in Saved. |
| 20 Sept 2026 | 11. Dictation | Speak into any comment box and the words are typed in. A switch in Setup turns it off. | A microphone button beside the wave button. A Voice section in Setup. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 10. Voice notes | Record, play, share and delete voice notes in every comment box. Clips stay on the phone. | A wave button in each comment box. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 8 and 9. Demo tournament | A demo tournament with 45 made-up games. The review table fits a laptop screen. The Saved tab count is a plain number with a yellow "waiting" badge. | "Demo and training" in Setup. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 7. Large improvement release | Score meanings, Communication, feedback and private notes, role and level, quick notes, Setup with QR code, referee list, provisional ranks, coach marking, coverage list, tournament code, compact layout, better contrast, "Start next game", sun mode. | A Setup tab and a "Match details" fold. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 6. Tabs at the top | The tabs moved to the top so a hosting badge no longer covered them. | Tabs at the top of the screen. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 5. New Zealand rugby look | Black jersey theme, Barlow fonts, te reo Māori labels, New Zealand dates and times, new app icon. | A black header with a large white 7. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 4. Email | "Email this form" opens the phone's mail app with the summary. The app remembers the addresses. | An "Email a copy to" box. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 3. Upload | "Upload results", Tournament and Game fields, upload status on each form, "Load results file". | An "Upload results" button. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 2. Referee review | A Review tab that ranks referees by average rating, with tournament and date filters. | A Review tab. |
| 19 Sept 2026 | 1. First release | The Excel sheet as an installable app that works offline. It has six areas plus a rating, comments, distance from contest, a saved list, CSV and backup export, share, copy and print. | A green theme. |

The release number matched the cache name in `sw.js` (`sevens-form-v11`) through release 11. The cache name has
not changed release to release since; the app still refreshes its files in the background each time it is opened
(see `sw.js`).

## Update a phone and check its release

A phone gets a new release the second time the app opens after the release goes live. Updating never deletes saved forms.

1. Open the app with signal. The phone loads the new files in the background.
2. Close the app fully.
3. Open the app again. The new release shows.
4. If the app still looks old, close it and open it once more.

The app does not show a release number yet. Use the features on the screen to tell which release a phone has.

| If the phone shows | The release is at least |
| --- | --- |
| A Review tab | 2 |
| An "Upload results" button | 3 |
| An "Email a copy to" box | 4 |
| A black header with a large white 7 | 5 |
| Tabs at the top of the screen | 6 |
| A Setup tab and a "Match details" fold | 7 |
| "Demo and training" in Setup | 8 |
| A wave button in each comment box | 10 |
| A microphone button beside the wave button | 11 |
| A bin icon on each row in Saved | 12 |
| A "Select forms to delete" button above the Saved list | 13 |
| "Tap a score to set it..." shown above the score rows | 14 |
| A "Sort by" box above the referee ranking on a phone | 15 |
| "Referees and coaches" under "This device" in Setup | 16 |
| A "Feedback" section in Setup | 18 |

Clearing browser data, or removing the app, deletes saved forms and voice notes. Ask the coach to save a backup file first. Backup files do not hold voice notes.

## Troubleshooting

Most problems come from signal, permissions, or the way iPhone stores data. A form is safe on the phone until the coach deletes it or clears browser data.

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Upload did not work" or "No connection" | No signal, or SnapItForms did not answer. | The form is safe. Move to signal and tap Upload again. Or use "Upload all waiting" on the Saved tab. |
| "Add your name first" | The coach name is empty. | Open "Match details", type the name, and upload again. |
| A yellow number on the Saved tab | Forms are waiting to upload. | Open Saved and tap "Upload all waiting". |
| Saved forms are missing on an iPhone | Safari and the Home Screen icon keep separate storage. | Always open the app from its icon. Restore old forms from a backup file. |
| The phone shows an old release | The update needs two opens. | Close and open the app twice, with signal. |
| Forms and voice notes vanished | Browser data was cleared, or the app was removed. | Restore forms from the latest backup file. Voice notes cannot be restored. |
| "The microphone is blocked" | The coach refused the permission. | Allow the microphone for the site in the phone or browser settings. |
| No dictation button | The browser has no dictation, or dictation is off. | Check Setup, then Voice. Use the microphone on the keyboard. The wave button still works. |
| Dictation says it needs a network | Dictation uses an online speech service. | Get signal, or record a voice note. |
| Dictation gets words or names wrong | The speech service does not know names or te reo Māori. | Check the text and type the names. |
| A voice note will not share | The phone cannot share audio files from a web app. | Share the summary text instead. Note the phone model and browser for support. |
| A voice note is missing on another phone or in a backup | Clips stay on the phone that recorded them. | This is by design. Voice notes are not in backups, uploads or emails. |
| The QR scan does not work | The camera is blocked, the light is low, or the code is very dense. | Allow the camera and hold steady. Or paste the setup link. Long referee lists make dense codes, so share the link. |
| On an iPhone the camera app opens Safari | Safari has separate storage from the Home Screen app. | Scan inside the app: Setup, then "Scan a setup QR code". Or paste the link there. |
| "Load results file" skips rows | The tournament code is wrong or missing. | Check the code in Setup. The message shows how many rows were skipped. |
| A referee is missing from the ranking | Too few games, or a filter hides them. | Lower "Minimum games". Set Role to the right role. Clear the tournament and date filters. |
| The same referee shows twice | Two spellings of one name. | Under "Names", tap "Merge". |
| The page shows "404" just after a release | GitHub Pages needs a minute or two to publish. | Wait and reload. |
| The date box shows the month first | The date box follows the phone's language setting. | Set the phone's region to New Zealand. |
| Demo forms appear on a real phone | Someone loaded the demo. | Setup, then "Demo and training", then "Remove the demo data". Real forms stay. |

## Data and privacy

Forms stay on the phone until the coach uploads, shares, emails or exports them. Dictation is the one feature that sends audio away automatically. Results name real people, so keep the SnapItForms account private and follow your privacy rules.

| Data | Where it goes | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scores and comments | The phone's browser storage. | As the coach types. |
| An uploaded form, including private notes, coach name and tournament code | The SnapItForms dashboard, in the organiser's account. | When the coach taps Upload. |
| Voice notes | The phone only. Not in uploads, backups or emails. | When the coach records. Deleting a form deletes its clips. |
| Dictation audio | The browser's speech service: Google on Android Chrome, Apple on iPhone. | While the coach dictates. A warning shows on first use. A switch in Setup turns it off. |
| A shared or emailed summary | The person the coach picks. Private notes are left out. | When the coach taps Share or Email. |
| Backup and CSV files | Wherever the coach saves them. They include private notes. | When the coach exports. |
| A setup link or QR code | Anyone who has it. It holds the tournament code and the referee and coach names. | When the organiser shares it. |
| Feedback text, the tournament name, the coach's name and the phone's browser details | The SnapItForms dashboard, in the organiser's account, told apart by a `kind` field. | When the coach taps "Send feedback" in Setup. |
| Demo data | The phone only. It is never uploaded. | When someone loads the demo. |

## Known limits

The app has not been tested on real phones yet. Everything below is either a design limit or a check still to do.

**Not yet tested**

- Voice notes, dictation and QR scanning were tested in simulated browsers with a fake microphone, a fake camera and a made-up speech service. Real phones may differ, especially an iPhone Home Screen app.
- SnapItForms' entry limits on a free or trial plan are not confirmed. Run a practice event with about 20 to 30 uploads before a tournament to find out in practice, or ask SnapItForms support directly.
- SnapItForms has been tested with a real access key, including a real submission checked end to end: a genuine 200 response from `api.snapitforms.com`, with working CORS support.
- GitHub Pages itself has not been used for a real tournament yet. Confirmed only that it serves the site correctly.

**Design limits**

- The app shows no release number.
- Coaching-results upload and feedback are both on trial with SnapItForms, a vendor with no independent track record at the time this shipped. Either may need to move again.
- The repo is public. No coaching data lives in it, but this is a real change from how the project started, worth knowing before adding anything to the repo.
- No licence is set for the code, public or not.
- The organiser cannot read results live in the app. Export the entries from the SnapItForms dashboard, then use "Load results file".
- Voice notes are not uploaded, not in backups and not in emails.
- Dictation needs signal and sends audio to the browser's speech service.
- The tournament code is a filter, not a password.
- The coverage list is a list, not a grid of referees by game.
- Whichever backend is used, changing the upload field names breaks anyone's saved export or in-progress CSV.

**Content still to check**

- The score meanings and quick-note phrases are drafts. Agree them with the coaches.
- A fluent te reo Māori speaker should check the labels.

## Support reference

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Live address | https://jonobakernz.github.io/sevens-coaching-form/. This is the one to give coaches. |
| Old address, retired | https://easy-goingcrow.staticdomains.app/. Uploads and feedback do not work there. Point any coach still using it to the live address above. |
| The repo is public | GitHub Pages does not support private repositories on the Free plan. No coaching data lives in the repo -- only in SnapItForms. See "Keeping the repo public safe" in the README. |
| Coaching results and feedback (from release 22) | Both go to SnapItForms, told apart by the `kind` field (results have none set; feedback has `kind: feedback`). Export from the SnapItForms dashboard as CSV. |
| Coaching results (25 Sept 2026, release 21) | Also went to SnapItForms, but a hosting problem fixed in release 22 may have stopped some of these reaching the dashboard. Check with coaches active that day if results are missing. |
| Coaching results (releases 3 to 20) | Stored with the site's original hosting provider. Sign in to that account to retrieve old entries. |
| SnapItForms track record | None found independently as of Sept 2026 -- no Capterra/G2 listing, no Reddit or Hacker News mention, no GitHub presence. Watch it closely. If it proves unreliable, moving to Formspree, Basin, Getform/Forminit, or an in-house Power Automate/Azure option is a similar-sized change to this one. |
| Deploy (GitHub Pages) | Automatic after every push to `main`. No workflow or secret needed. Usually live within a minute or two. |
| Offline cache | The cache name in `sw.js` (`CACHE`) has stayed at `sevens-form-v11` since release 11. The app still refreshes its files in the background on each open regardless -- see `sw.js`. Bump `CACHE` by hand if you ever need every phone to drop its old cache in one go. |
| Upload fields | Do not add or rename fields in `UP_FIELDS` (`index.html`) without a plan, whichever backend is in use. `node tools/check.js` catches an accidental change. |
| Licence | Still not set (see the README). The repo being public does not mean anyone else has permission to reuse the code -- that is a separate, still-open decision. |
| Wording | Score meanings, quick notes and the referee, coach and level lists are set in the app script and the Setup tab. The README explains where. |

**Housekeeping**

- Delete the test entries in the SnapItForms dashboard: anything with a tournament or message clearly marked as a test.
- Rotate the SnapItForms access key if it has ever been shared outside the app itself.
- Decide whether to remove the retired `deploy-static-app.yml` workflow (and its `STATICAPP_API_KEY` secret) now that GitHub Pages is the live site.
- Decide on a licence for the now-public code, or explicitly decide not to and note that choice somewhere.
