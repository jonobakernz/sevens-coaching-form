# Sevens Coaching Form

A phone app for rugby referee coaches at sevens tournaments. A coach scores a game, saves it on the phone, and
uploads it. Organisers rank referees across many games and coaches.

It is a progressive web app: plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no build step and no server code. It works
offline.

## What it does

**Coaches**
- Score 8 areas from 1 to 5: fitness, foul play, breakdowns, set phase, game awareness, game management, communication, and an overall rating.
- Tap quick notes, add comments, and write "Strength to keep" and "One thing to work on".
- Write private notes that are left out of the summary, email and print.
- Dictate into any comment box: tap the microphone and speak, and the words are typed in. Say "full stop", "comma", "question mark" or "new line" for punctuation.
- Record a voice note in any comment box (the 8 areas, distance from contest, the two feedback boxes and private notes). Play it back, record again, delete it, or share it.
- Save on the device, upload with one tap, email or share a summary, print or save a PDF.
- Work offline. Forms wait on the phone until there is signal.
- Send feedback about the app from Setup, straight to the organiser.

**Organisers**
- Make a setup link and QR code with the tournament name, a tournament code, and lists of fields, levels, coaches and referees.
- Rank referees, with provisional marks for few games, coach marking style adjustment, a coverage list, and a name merge tool.
- Load a results file (CSV or JSON) and export the ranking as CSV.

**Demo**
- Setup, then Demo and training, loads 45 made-up games. Demo forms are never uploaded.

## Release notes

See [docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md](docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md) for what changed in each release, a troubleshooting table for support, and a data and privacy summary.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The whole app: page, styles and script |
| `sw.js` | Service worker for offline use |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | Install details |
| `icons/`, `fonts/` | App icons and the Barlow fonts (SIL Open Font License) |
| `lib/` | QR code maker and QR scanner. Loaded only when used. See `lib/LICENSES.txt` |
| `demo/` | Made-up tournament data: `demo.json`, plus a CSV and a backup file for testing |
| `tools/` | Scripts that make the demo data and the icons |
| `docs/` | Release notes and the demo overview picture |
| `.github/workflows/` | Runs `node tools/check.js` on every pull request |

## Run it on your computer

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000. Service workers and the camera work on `localhost`. Phones need HTTPS.

## Deploy

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages: <https://jonobakernz.github.io/sevens-coaching-form/>.

Pages redeploys automatically a short time after every push to `main` -- no workflow or secret is needed for it.
Merging a pull request to `main` is what puts a change live, so treat every merge as a release.

Phones cache the app for offline use, so a release does not reach everyone straight away. `CACHE` in `sw.js`
changes on each release; once a phone has the new files, it picks them up after two opens.

## Keeping the repo public safe

GitHub Pages does not support private repositories on the Free plan, so this repo is public. Nothing sensitive
lives in it:

- No real coaching data, referee names, or coach names live in this repo. Real results and feedback live in
  SnapItForms. The repo only ever holds fictional demo data (see `demo/`).
- `SNAPIT_ACCESS_KEY` in `index.html` sits in plain sight, same as it is already visible to anyone who views the
  live page's source. It is not a security secret -- anyone who has it can send junk into the SnapItForms
  dashboard, so do not advertise it beyond what is needed to run the app.
- Before adding anything else to this repo, read `CLAUDE.md`'s rule about never putting real names in it -- that
  matters more once it is in the public history.

## Results, feedback and SnapItForms

Coaching-results uploads and in-app feedback both go to [SnapItForms](https://snapitforms.com/), a third-party
form backend. It is new to this project, so watch real submissions closely and be ready to move to another
service if it does not hold up.

- Each game, and each piece of feedback, is one submission in the SnapItForms dashboard, told apart by a `kind`
  field. Export it from there as CSV.
- `SNAPIT_ACCESS_KEY`, near the top of `index.html`, must hold a real access key from your SnapItForms account
  before uploads or feedback will do anything. `node tools/check.js` fails on the placeholder value on purpose,
  so a deploy with no key configured is caught before it goes out.
- If a submission fails for a reason other than "no signal" (SnapItForms down, a rejected key), the coach sees a
  generic failure message. Either way the form or the feedback text stays on the phone until it sends -- nothing
  is lost.
- Do not add or rename fields in `UP_FIELDS` (`index.html`) without a plan. Anyone exporting a CSV, or loading an
  older one, expects the column names to stay put. `node tools/check.js` catches an accidental change.
- Nothing in the app reads results back live. Export the entries, then use Review, then Load results file.

## Data on the phone

- Forms live in each phone's browser storage. Tell coaches to save a backup file after each event.
- Voice notes are audio clips kept in the phone's IndexedDB. They are **not** uploaded and **not** in backup
  files. Share summary sends them with the text where the phone allows it. The email button cannot attach files.
  Clips are limited to 2 minutes (`VN_MAX` in `index.html`). For text the organiser can read, use the microphone
  on the phone keyboard.
- Deleting a form deletes its voice notes.
- Dictation uses the browser's Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`). **It sends the audio to the browser maker's
  speech service** (Google on Android Chrome, Apple on iPhone). It needs signal, shows a one-time warning, and
  can be switched off in Setup. It is hidden in browsers without the API (Firefox, and some iPhone Home Screen
  apps). Te reo Māori words often come out wrong. Voice notes are separate: they stay on the phone.
- Dictation and voice notes both use the microphone, so only one can run at a time.
- On iPhone, Safari and the Home Screen icon keep separate storage. Install first, then always open from the
  icon.
- The tournament code is a filter, not a password. Anyone who has it can send results.
- Results name real people. Keep exports and your SnapItForms account private, and follow your privacy rules (for
  example the NZ Privacy Act 2020).

## Change the content

- **Score wording:** `ANCHORS` at the top of the script in `index.html`.
- **Areas and quick notes:** the `SECTIONS` list.
- **Te reo Māori labels:** the `<i lang="mi">` tags in the form. Have a fluent speaker check them.
- **Colours and type:** the CSS variables at the top of the styles. There are light, dark and sun themes.
- **Demo data:** edit and run `python3 tools/generate_demo.py`.

## Checks and Claude Code

- `node tools/check.js` runs quick checks: scripts parse, manifest and cached files exist, the upload fields have not changed by accident, and no keys are in the files. The **Checks** workflow runs it on every pull request.
- `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules for Claude Code. It works on a branch and opens a pull request. You merge it, and the merge deploys.

## Tests

There is no test suite in the repo. The app was checked with Playwright on phone-size screens, an accessibility
scan (axe), a fake camera for QR scanning, a fake microphone for voice notes, and a mock of `fetch` for
SnapItForms uploads and feedback. Real speech recognition and a real SnapItForms submission have not been
tested. Add your own tests if you grow the app.

## Licence

**No licence is set for the app code, and the repo is public.** With no licence file, default copyright applies:
the code is visible to anyone, but nobody else has legal permission to copy, modify or reuse it. If that is not
what you want -- for example if you would rather explicitly allow or explicitly forbid reuse -- add a `LICENSE`
file stating your choice. Third-party code and fonts keep their own licences (see `lib/LICENSES.txt` and
`fonts/LICENSE.txt`).
